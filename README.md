## The general purpose of this project is to create a database of yelp reviews to query off of
# and show proficiency in Python, SQL, and various methods of analysis.

# One of the starting ideas of the project was to make a trip-planner that could suggest the "worst" places to stop
# given a start and ending destination. There are a million lists of the best places, 
# optimizing the opposite goal I think could be individual in itself, 
# proving not to have copied someone elses analysis, as well as have some comedic value as well.

# the yelp dataset is available for download for personal, educational and academic purposes
# and is comprised of JSON files of reviews, businesses, users, and others
# https://www.yelp.com/dataset

# The project also involves using a MYSQL database, and those links and instructions are available here:

######### IDEAS/OPTIMIZATIONS #############
# some immediate optimizations that come to mind would be matching review/business/user records and then
# limiting the results for computation speed afterwards. 
# Right now i'm just reading the first x lines of the file and getting whatever records match across the board

# maybe read the business file first, get x number of businesses for each state and then fetch the reviews 
# and users for those businesses?
